## Description

This is my password generator.  To build this application I used simple javascript to ask the user for their input, and based on their answers produce a password that meets their requirements. If you require a strong password, my generator can provide what you need!

From there you can click the generate password button and you will be asked a series of questions about the contents of your password. After the prompts, your password will generate into the text area where you can highlight and copy!
